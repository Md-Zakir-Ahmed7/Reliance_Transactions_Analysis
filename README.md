## **Project: RELIANCE TRANSACTIONS DATA ANALYSIS**  

### **Project Overview:**  
This project involves analyzing transaction data from Reliance using **Power Query** for data transformation and **Power BI** for visualization and reporting. The objective is to extract valuable insights from large volumes of transaction data, identify trends, and support data-driven decision-making.

### **Tools Used:**  
- **Power Query:** Data cleaning, transformation, and shaping  
- **Power BI:** Data modeling, dashboard creation, and reporting  

### **Key Steps in the Project:**  

#### **1. Data Extraction & Cleaning (Power Query)**  
- Imported raw transaction data from multiple sources (Excel, SQL Server, or CSV files).  
- Cleaned and transformed the data (handled missing values, removed duplicates, and formatted date fields).  
- Merged datasets, performed column calculations, and created new metrics as required.  

#### **2. Data Modeling & DAX Calculations (Power BI)**  
- Established relationships between different tables (Customer, Transactions, Products, etc.).  
- Created **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** measures to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:  
  - Total Sales  
  - Transaction Count  
  - Average Transaction Value  
  - Customer Segmentation Metrics  

#### **3. Dashboard Development (Power BI)**  
- Designed interactive dashboards with visualizations, including:  
  - **Sales Performance Analysis:** Trends over time, sales breakdown by category and location.  
  - **Customer Insights:** Purchase behavior, frequency, and customer segmentation.  
  - **Transaction Trends:** Peak transaction times, most popular products, and revenue distribution.  
  - **Profitability Analysis:** Identifying high-revenue and high-profit transactions.  

#### **4. Insights & Business Impact**  
- Identified peak sales periods and customer buying patterns.  
- Detected high-value customers and optimized marketing strategies.  
- Improved decision-making with real-time interactive reports.  

### **Conclusion**  
The **Reliance Transactions Data Analysis** project provided valuable insights into sales, customer behavior, and transaction trends. Using **Power Query** for efficient data transformation and **Power BI** for visualization, this analysis helped in strategic planning and data-driven business decisions.
